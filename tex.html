<h1>QuestionTeX format</h1>

<b>QuestionTeX</b> is a collection of LaTeX-macros that enables authors to
create multiple-choice-tests with ease.<br>
For each type of question there is an environment that contains all
the information about the question (e.g.  
\begin{multichoice}...\end{multichoice})<br></br>. 
 The pieces of information are supplied via predefined
 commands (e.g. \true{A true answer.}) so that they can be pro cessed by a
 computer, which allows for the following automated deployment mechanisms:
 
<ul>
  <li>Creation of a printer's copy with standardized
  layout and in high quality</li>
  <li>Creation of a solution, including additional feedback </li>
  <li>Creation of an interactive online-test (CAT)</li>
  <li>Import of questions into Moodle LMS</li>
</ul>

The fastest way to get an overview about which command does what is
to have a look at the template file that comes with this package.<br></br>
