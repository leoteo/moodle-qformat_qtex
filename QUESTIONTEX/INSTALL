General Remarks
===============

 - A documentation of the QuestionTeX format as well as several examples
   can be found on our homepage www.lemuren.math.ethz.ch
 - This plugin was written for Moodle 1.9.4. Other versions have not been
   tested. A version for Moodle 2.0 will probably be released.  
 - For handling of images, PHP's Zip extension is required.

Installing the QuestionTeX import/export format in Moodle
=========================================================

In order to install the plugin on your Moodle installation, you need only the
files from the 'plugin' folder.

 - Create a new folder "qtex" in $moodle_root/question/format
 - Copy format.php and config.php to $moodle_root/question/format/qtex
 - Copy qformat_qtex.php to $moodle_root/lang/en_utf8

A new "qtex" format will appear in question export/import dialogues.
