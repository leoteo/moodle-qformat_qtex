QuestionTeX format plugin
-------------------------

QuestionTeX is a collection of LaTeX macros that enables authors 
to create multiple-choice tests.
A documentation of the QuestionTeX format as well as several examples
are available on

    www.lemuren.math.ethz.ch

The QuestionTeX format plugin enables the import of questions 
written in QuestionTeX directly into Moodle (as well as the
export from Moodle to QuestionTeX).

This plugin has been written in the LEMUREN project at ETH Zurich.
