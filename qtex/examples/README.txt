QuestionTeX examples
--------------------

Some minimalistic examples of QuestionTeX  that may be used to test the import
to Moodle via the QuestionTeX plugin.

  - ex01-basic.tex
     contains a single question with some formulae in it.
  - ex02-images.zip 
     contains a few questions which include images in png format.
     By providing those images in the zip file, these images
     can be automatically imported into Moodle.
